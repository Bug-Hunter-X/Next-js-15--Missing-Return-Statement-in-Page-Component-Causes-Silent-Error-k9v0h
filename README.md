# Next.js 15 Silent Error: Missing Return Statement in Page Component

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Next.js 15 where a missing `return` statement in a page component leads to a runtime error without clear error messages.

## Problem

In Next.js 15, if you omit the `return` statement in a page component's function, it will silently fail.  The application will load, but the component's content will not render.  The error is not easily detectable because the console does not provide a helpful message directly pointing to the missing return statement.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to `/about`.  You'll see a blank page or unexpected behavior; the console may or may not show a generic error.

## Solution

The solution is simply to add the `return` statement to the `About` page component (see the `aboutSolution.js` file).

This issue highlights the importance of rigorous testing and checking for these types of easily overlooked errors in Next.js applications.
